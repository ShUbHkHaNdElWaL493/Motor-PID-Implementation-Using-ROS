# Motor-PID-Implementation-Using-ROS

This repository contains the code for the application of velocity PID to an RMCS DC motor with STM32F401CC through the use of ROS(Robot Operating System) Noetic Ninjemys and ROS Serial.
Before using the code, import the ros_lib library for the respective microcontroller in the lib folder.
The code has been programmed using Visual Studio Code through the PlatformIO extension.
